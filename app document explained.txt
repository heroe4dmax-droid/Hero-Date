Absolutely ✅ — here’s a typical app.json for an Expo React Native app, set up for your dating app. This file defines your app’s metadata, icons, splash screen, and general Expo configuration

	•	Replace "com.yourname.datingapp" with your own unique package identifier.
	•	Make sure icon and splash images exist in src/assets/images/.
	•	You can customize background colors, splash images, and orientation as needed
	
//use
npx expo install @react-navigation/native
npx expo install @react-navigation/stack
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context

✅ What this gives you:
	•	A Home Screen with a header and navigation to the profile.
	•	A Profile Screen showing your avatar and basic info.
	•	A clean, modern structure that you can easily expand (e.g., add login, matches, chats).
